    impact: "I'm so grateful for your wonderful kindness and connectedness that you bring not only to my life but to all the people you share your friendship with.",
    unforgettableMemory: "I've got one heartfelt memory: the first time you met and held Harper, the love and fear of not holding her correctly and how you expressed that you had an overwhelming sense to protect her. You are still one of the kindest and most caring people I've met.\n\nThe other is the invention of Butt Jousting, please have him explain haha",
    whatToHear: "We are so lucky that we voice our support all the time but thank you for being a great friend and still being in my life.",

    name: "Holmes",
    impact: "Ryan, you are very consistently ready to: -, be friendly - talk about something interesting - respond to something I think is interesting - party and bring party energy - sing (e g. Holy Diver)\n\nI am also a big Sofia fan, and I really like how much you believe in her, encourage her, and hype her up",
    unforgettableMemory: "For me the Planet Sofia hosting was really remarkable. I also like Ryan's enthusiasm for stoner metal!",
    whatToHear: "Aw, I'm not sure on this one. I think I'd normally say all the things. I really mean the stuff I said above about liking how consistently ready Ryan is. I like how well-rounded and well-grounded Ryan is too. That quality a little rare in our scene, or my scene, and it's nice. Also Ryan has really great masculine energy I mean come on!",
    loveAdmire: "People who aren't bogged down by all the American-ness of Americans (and some of the scars of growing up here) but have the earnestness, non-cynicism, excitement, alignment, optimism, and directness that it's hard to find in most of the world.",
    growthArea: "Hmm I'm always rooting for people to get grimier but not if it comes at the cost of any of the qualities above!! I dunno. More anal sex, or train hopping, or smaller metal shows and make friends, or freak out a little and do something a little crazy at work to try to speed things up or go big. Fire somebody you know you want to fire. I really don't know but get in there!",
    yearVision: "Something grimy",
    reflections: "I really like how you, Sofia and Ryan, do things like this for each other! I like how you put people on the spot and feel good doing that üíú‚ù§Ô∏è"

  {
    name: "Mat Allen",
    impact: "Holy shit dude, you've completely changed the trajectory of my life at least twice. Not many people have done that. Being in the Bay has dramatically changed my life and twice when I was seriously considering moving back you kept me around. It's inspiring to see your zany side while also upholding a strong professional career while also doing good; you take having fun seriously and are serious about making the world better, and that's really inspiring.\n\nI really appreciate you Ryan, you've consistently been a stellar person to know and am so grateful we're friends.",
    unforgettableMemory: "oh my god, at vibe gala we were dancing and I was hit with this realization that \"there was literally nothing else I'd rather be doing right now.\" That was such a special moment to me.\n\nAnother, as soon as I found \"Cool Cat\" I had the thought \"damn, we should've been partying this whole time\"",
    whatToHear: "You're a beautiful, beautiful human being Ryan. I love you dearly and genuinely wish more people were like you.",
    loveAdmire: "I love your weird so much. I love your depth, how we can party and have fun, but also get into the tougher conversations and sit with it. That's a type of maturity I want to be around. Dancing with you is literally one of my favorite things",
    growthArea: "I think you have strong opinions and I wonder if it'd be helpful to hear people's thoughts more before adding your own. There can be an inherent bias to trust people that speak with authority and that can dissuade people from sharing their own, or trusting it (I might be biased in the opposite direction though)",
    yearVision: "I have no doubt he'll continue on the smashing success he's already been doing, and on the path towards. I expect that he'll face setbacks but nothing that will be too much.\n\nI hope you both are able to get your house setup and form a good group of people to be around. I'm very excited about this, and for what the rest of the year has in store for you :)",
    reflections: "This is such a cute idea!! Thanks for creating this and sending this to me. I'm not always great with words and I appreciate this opportunity to get to share with you <3\n\nLove you guys!"

    name: "Josh",
    impact: "How does any best mate impact a life? To grow together while directing each others path (and music taste) in a million small ways. Constant and lasting, Ryan is apart of my life, not an impact on it.",
    unforgettableMemory: "Driving along Tally, and out to Burleigh. The early days of crazy weird movie nights. Walking the streets of Byron Bay in the heat of summer.",
    whatToHear: "You are gentle and driven. A combination that is extremely rare and almost completely lost to ancient times.",
    loveAdmire: "Ryan uses his extreme intelligence to better the world and protect its future.",
    growthArea: "Find a nice place and sit. No music, drugs, problem solving, or worrying about work tomorrow. Be in your body, but out of your world. Just sit quietly.",
    yearVision: "This year will have less problems to manage on behalf of others. A year of steady growth and calmly beeing on top of tasks. A year where your team will find its groove.",

    name: "Sophie",
    impact: "A wonderful conversationalist, a technological optimist and loving best friend to one of the best persons I know.",
    unforgettableMemory: "We were in the car, which is basically the modern confessional booth‚Äîexcept instead of revealing sins, we play each others obscure Spotify finds and pretend the GPS voice isn't secretly judging our turns. Josh‚Äî an old friend turned \"we are still working it out\" denial stage ‚Äîwas driving, and for once, he wasn't being casually possessive about controlling the AUX. Growth.\n\nPhone rings. He answers. On speakerphone. Not \"let's both hear this comfortably\" speakerphone. I mean the \"welcome to a TED Talk, here's the mic in your molars\" kind of loud.\n\nIt's his best friend, Ryan. Now, Ryan is the kind of guy who asks the emotionally loaded questions you'd normally leave to a therapist‚Äîor at least, a text message. He has all the tact of a toddler holding a live squirrel. Which is a trait, I believe, to be genuinely lovable and compelling. (I have the capacity to be quite similar).\n\nAs I set the scene, Josh is parking the car in a Coles car park. So, we're just vibing, and Ryan comes in hot with:\n\n\"Sooo... is she your actual girlfriend now, or‚Ä¶\"\n\nOh Ryan, you have the subtlety of a marching band and the filter of Facebook in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, I swear I could hear Josh's brain buffering. He looked at the phone like it had just asked him if he believed in moral relativism. I turned slowly, like the girl in a horror movie with a smirk that couldn't help him.\n\nThere were options here. Infinite ways to handle this.\n\n\"‚Ä¶Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"\n\nIt wasn't even a normal \"uhh.\" It was long. Like he thought if he stretched it out enough, maybe the question would vanish into the ether. Spoiler: it didn't.\n\nI smirked. Just turned to watch him squirm, utterly content. I could've helped him. Could've jumped in. But why interrupt greatness?\n\nRyan was loving it too.\n\nI leaned a little toward the phone and said, coolly:\n\n\"Thank you, Ryan. Thank you so much for asking this. That was beautiful.\"\n\nJosh groaned with a grin. I smiled like a cat in the sun.\n\nBecause sometimes love is soft and poetic.\n\nAnd sometimes it's a public identity crisis in a getz with two people smirking at your expense.",

    loveAdmire: "So many - see story",

    name: "Mel Kidd (Dad)",
    impact: "I could never have believed that my son Ryan would achieve all that he has over the last 30 years. I have enjoyed and have been proud, as a father, of Ryan's many achievements in all areas of his life. Excelling in all the years of his education, constantly winning awards and finally securing the job he worked so hard for. Ryan's All Saints yearbook read 'The person most likely to change the world'. Which he is doing now, well done, son.",
    unforgettableMemory: "Regina and I wanted Ryan to be accepted by All Saints Anglican School, but was informed that is was not possible. Ryan sat for the scholarship exam, excelling in English but did not make the grade in maths due to his previous schooling. So, he missed out. We asked for a meeting with the Headmaster Patrick Wallas, and it was granted. During that meeting, Ryan showed Patrick the book he was writing and they found they had a kinship in the literary interests. At that point, Ryan had talked his way into the school. The Headmaster's class was English for only the best students and Ryan was included. An annual literary contest called the Pegasus award was awarded annually by Patrick. Ryan got the bronze the first year, silver the second, and gold the third year with his short story. His story went on win an award with James Cook University with a cash prize and future publishing rights.",
    whatToHear: "Ryan, you have been a wonderful part of our family, doing everything that you set out to do in your life. I have enjoyed being there for your life experiences. You have made it, son, to be all you can be and there is more to come. Ryan, whatever you took on in life, being all the years of your education, becoming a Queen's Scout, constantly winning debating competitions, the gold Pegasus award and finally the Doctor of Philosophy degree in quantum physics. You did whatever was necessary and I am very proud of it all, thanks.",
    loveAdmire: "I think that Ryan is a very loving, enjoyable person who has studied intently to undertake the challenge to make the world a better place.",
    growthArea: "I hope you have learned that a balanced life with work, friends, exercise and sleep are all part of a good life and the best health.",
    yearVision: "This year will bring more recognition for your ambitious cause in the present and future of AI safety in all areas throughout the world. If only I could understand your papers....",
    reflections: "It seems you have surrounded yourself with good friends, and I hope it is not all work for you and that you are enjoying life."

    name: "Regina Kidd (Mum)",
    impact: "Becoming Ryan's mother was transformative, expanding my internal and external experiences and my capacity for loving, nurturing, and learning. Getting to know Ryan and how best to support him in all his life stages -- from an infant to adult -- became the most important mission in my life. With Ryan, I have explored, experienced and learned about so many subjects and places that I never would have otherwise. Ryan has enriched my life beyond measure and continues to reward me with opportunities to learn and grow.",
    unforgettableMemory: "Not long after Ryan turned 2, we went to the annual Takoma Park Folk Festival where we heard the artist Sue Ribaudo sing songs about the earth and the animals that live there. I bought the cassette tape of her album Earth Celebration and played it frequently in the car, with Ryan and I singing along. I remember (and recorded in my diary on Dec 10, 1997), 'Ryan asked to hear the song about the owls and the rainforest. The song is about various animals losing their habitat. [The title of the track is Where did the owl go?] Ryan said again, as he did a couple of weeks ago, \"We must go to the forest and save the animals.\"' From a very early age, Ryan had a desire to make a positive difference, to make the world a better place.\n\nMy memories of Ryan's childhood in the US are a collage of our visits to countless museums, art galleries, science centres, massive indoor play areas, concerts and festivals, puppet shows, gardens, nature and wildlife centres, parks and playgrounds, libraries, zoos, aquariums, even a water treatment plant because Ryan wanted to learn about water purification after watching The Magic School Bus At the Waterworks and reading the book. Ryan knew his way around many Smithsonian museums and had his favourite exhibits. These adventures together educated us both and enriched our relationship.\n\nRyan's hunger for books was insatiable; I read to him for hours each day, as did my mother when she visited. Ryan enjoyed repeat readings of favourite books and knew when even a small word had been skipped or added.\n\nI treasured the names and roles that Ryan assigned to me. First, I was Mommy Tiger and he was Baby Tiger, then we became bears, after that pigs, followed by pterodactyls, fruit bats, diplodocuses, kangaroos, elephants, mosasaurs, and penguins.",
    whatToHear: "Ryan means the world to me. He is my beloved son, also my teacher, a fellow traveller on the quest for knowledge and the exploration of ideas. Ryan is an integral part of my life experience and contributes to my sense of who I am in the world. Ryan lives in me; all of the contacts, connections, memories shape how I understand and experience the world. Although he lives geographically far away, Ryan is forever close and always present in my thoughts. My appreciation and love run deep!",

    name: "Sonia Albrecht",
    impact: "Your parties have been some of the best experiences of my life. Before them I merely felt grateful for the miracle of overcoming my autism enough to have friends outside my family. But your parties taught me that I could not only be not awkward all the time, but charismatic. Something about the creativity everywhere at them and the fun and your supportive presence has really made me come alive. It's been so much fun exploring this new playful side of myself. It's something I've been able to bring with me to other parts of my life, and I love it so much.",
    unforgettableMemory: "When you supported me as I was going through that terrifying experience with Thor. Low self esteem is my biggest weakness, and I was so critical of myself during it in ways I eventually overcame. It meant so much to me that someone I respect as much as you was less judgmental than I was worried about, even though Thor is a great guy when he's not triggered.",
    whatToHear: "Your work is so amazing. Thank you so much for doing so much to protect the world from perhaps the greatest challenge humanity has faced. It really inspires me to contribute more with my own career.",
    loveAdmire: "Despite how busy you are with such important work, you're very caring. For example, it comes through in the way you've mentored me in kink, in the way you check in when I've deleted a message, the way you care about how I'm treated as a Christian in the community, the way you were so caring towards Ella during your breakup, and the way you made me sing at your dollarvision party despite me desperately wanting to chicken out.",
    growthArea: "My weakly held view is that you could live more frugally so you could donate more to charity. It's cheaper to live a little south in Oakland and take a Lyft when it's dark than to pay so much for central Berkeley housing.",
    yearVision: "I'm so excited for you and Sofia's group house! The combination of groundbreaking work and beautiful creativity and deep personal growth that you and Sofia share is so wonderful. I'm so glad you've found someone just as unique and impressive as you to share your life with.",
    reflections: "Your lightning talks at the MATS parties are so awesome. It was my very first lightning talk, because you fostered such an exciting and supportive environment. I've since given so many amazing lightning talks, and it would have taken so much longer to get started without your vision."

The biggest single one: Ryan is responsible for referring me to my current job, which has completely changed my life by removing my depression and tripling my yearly income, as well as letting me work on the problem I consider to be most meaningful and important in the world. Ryan has also invited me to many cool events at which I made lasting friendships. Would recommend having Ryan as a friend.",

    loveAdmire: "I think there has always been a dedication to the greater good, to strive for betterrment., to know more about himself.",

    yearVision: "I hope Ryan continues to find satisfaction happiness, & joy in work, life, and love.",
    reflections: "So many snapshot memories. The first time I saw him attached to his mother's breast. The \"I'm not cake\" which became our special thing. Our shared joy of reading, and a shared view of the world. Caring for his friends, family & the world. Playing games together. Thank you Ryan for coming into our family. We are richer for it."
